Red Academy - Project 5 - Quotes on Dev

Ver 1.0.0

Things that I've learnt after finishing this project using Wordpress:
* using Gutenberg blocks 
* making a GET request to a WP REST API endpoint using Ajax to dynamically add a new quote to the front page, and corresponding update the URL using the History API
* making a POST request to a WP REST API endpoint using Ajax to submit a new quote to the site
* more knowledge on HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP


Things that I would like to improve for this project:
* create a custom WP API endpoint with your custom field data included, rather than modifying the exist post endpoint
* write a validation function for the quotes submitted
